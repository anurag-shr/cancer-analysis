# 🧬 Cancer Diagnosis: Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

> An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project to uncover how tumor size and treatment types impact survival outcomes in cancer patients.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project dives into a synthetic cancer diagnosis dataset to analyze patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment outcomes. The aim is to extract insights that could guide early diagnosis and inform better treatment strategies.

I created this project to sharpen my Python data analytics skills while exploring real-world healthcare problems—merging my interests in **Bioinformatics**, **HealthTech**, and **Data for Good**.

## 🧠 Key Questions Explored

- Do larger tumor sizes correlate with lower survival rates?
- How do different treatments influence patient outcomes?
- Is there a link between biopsy results and survival?
- What patterns exist across age, gender, and tumor types?    

---

## 📊 Dataset Features
The dataset was acquired from Kaggle for exploration

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Patient_ID`
- `Age`
- `Gender`
- `Tumor_Size(cm)`
- `Tumor_Type`
- `Biopsy_Result` (Benign / Malignant)
- `Treatment` (Chemotherapy, Radiation, Surgery, etc.)
- `Response_to_Treatment`
- `Survival_Status` (Survived / Not Survived)

*(Note: This is a synthetic dataset used for educational purposes.)*

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas & NumPy 🧮
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊
- Sikit-Learn

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Tumor size tends to be larger in patients who did not survive.
- Chemotherapy showed a better survival response.
- There was no evident relationship seen between Age, Tumor Size, and Survival.
- Younger patients had lower incidence compared to Older patients.

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

Here are some of the visual insights created in the notebook:

- Tumor Size vs. Survival Status
- Treatment Type vs. Response to Treatment
- Gender-wise Tumor Type Distribution
- Correlation heatmaps for numeric features

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- 🔮 Add a simple predictive model for survival status
- 📦 Deploy as an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
- 🧠 Write a blog breaking down the analysis (coming soon!)
